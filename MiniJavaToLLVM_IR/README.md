# MiniJavaToLLVM_IR
A parser, syntax checker and LLVM IR Generator for a [subset of Java](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~sguyer/classes/comp181-2006/minijava.html "subset of Java") written in Java.
Uses [JavaCC](https://javacc.github.io/javacc/ "JavaCC") and a modified version of [JTB](http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/ "JTB") for the parsing and the syntax checking.
The output is an [LLVM Assembly Language](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html "LLVM Assembly Language") compatible file.

##### Note:
The documentation is rather incomplete due to the project having been completed roughly 1 year ago.
